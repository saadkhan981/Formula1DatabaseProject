Formula 1 Database Project

This database will maintain the records of points earned by each driver in each race for each Season.

10 teams | 20 drivers | 22 races | 440 race results | 1 champion

Since per team there are two drivers and per season there will be 22 races therefore total number of race results (entries) will be 440. The driver with most points, will win the championship.

Project idea and why it interests me: 

To develop a database for a racing competition e.g., Formula 1 (F1). Involving multiple teams, multiple drivers with race taking place on different locations all around the world. 

I started following F1 after watching Netflix series namely “Drive to Survive” in 2019. It’s so thrilling and exciting. It does not only depend upon the technology of the car and driver capabilities rather it’s a team effort including contributions from strategy engineers, analyst, team principal and even from the tire changing crew.

Use Case Scenario:

Below could be use case scenarios that any racing association (for example Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)”)

1.     Any racing association or FIA wants to know Top 10 Drivers based on the points they earned during the season 2021? Also mention which Team they belong to. Since Driver with most points will be the champion for year 2021.

2.     FIA wants to know that which Teams failed to even complete the race during season 2021 and what was there failure rate in season 2021?

3.     The racing association wants to know the Driver, who won most races in the season 2021?

4.     Which two teams are the most competitive? Tell by showing the number of wins by each Team in season 2021?

5.     Which is the longest track in season 2021?

6.     What are the top three manufacturers, of which PowerUnits were used most by Teams during Season 2021?

7.     FIA wants to categorize Drivers who won atleast one race into four skill sets (as ‘Leader’, ‘Competitor’, ‘Experienced’ and ‘Beginner’) based on the total number of wins in Season 2021.

8.     FIA wants to rank Teams. The ranking is done based on the number of wins in Season 2021.

9.     FIA wants to know the Lead and Support role of each Driver within a Team. Since every team has one Lead Driver and one Support Driver.(Using WITH Clause and Ranking with Partition).

10.  FIA wants to know the TeamHead and Driver of each team in the same table with Name along with Team_ID.

11.  FIA want to know Drivers, who did not won any race or didn’t secured 1st position in any of the race from all 22 races throughout the season.

12.  The racing association wants to know only Top 5 Drivers, based on the points they earned throughout the season 2021?
